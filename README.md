# Welcome to my source repository

Here I will put the source code to some awesome functions that I have written 
myself and find useful. To get any function in your own R session type the 
following in your R console/file:

[source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anjo0511/source/master/name-of-the-function-you-like")](https://github.com/anjo0511/source)


**"name-of-the-function-you-like"** is self explanatory dont you think? ;)
